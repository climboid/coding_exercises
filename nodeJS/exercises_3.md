Certainly! Here are three challenging Node.js coding exercises at different difficulty levels, along with the topics they test and their answers:

**Topic: Asynchronous Control Flow and Promises**

**Exercise:**
Write a Node.js program that reads a list of URLs from a file named "urls.txt" and sends HTTP GET requests to each URL concurrently. Collect the responses and print the content of the first successful response or an error message if all requests fail.



**Topic: Creating an API with Authentication**

**Exercise:**
Build a Node.js API that serves as a user authentication system with user registration, login, and token-based authentication. Implement endpoints for user registration, user login, and a protected resource that requires a valid access token for access.



**Topic: Building a Full-Stack Application**

**Exercise:**
Create a full-stack application that includes a Node.js backend and a front-end using a framework like React or Angular. The application should allow users to register, log in, create, update, and delete items, and the data should be stored in a database. Implement authentication and validation throughout the application.
