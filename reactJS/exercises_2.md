###Topic: React Component Lifecycle and Fetching Data

**Exercise:**
Create a React component called `UserList` that fetches a list of users from an API (you can use the JSONPlaceholder API, for example) and displays their names in a list. Ensure that the API call is made when the component is mounted. You should handle loading and error states.



###Topic: React Context and useContext

**Exercise:**
Create a React context and provider for managing user authentication. Implement a `UserContext` that stores the user's authentication status and username. Create two components: `Login` and `Profile`. The `Login` component allows users to log in and set their username in the context. The `Profile` component displays the user's username and a button to log out.



###Topic: React Performance Optimization and Memoization

**Exercise:**
Create a performance-optimized React component that renders a list of items. The list can be large, so implement a feature to filter items by name. Ensure that the component re-renders efficiently when the filter input changes, without re-rendering the entire list.
