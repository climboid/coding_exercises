Certainly! Here are three Python coding exercises at different difficulty levels, along with the topics they test and their answers:

**Topic: Lists and Loops**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of the positive numbers in the list. If there are no positive numbers in the list, return a message indicating that.



**Topic: Recursion and Algorithms**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.



**Topic: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python program that finds the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of numbers. The subsequence does not have to be contiguous, but the numbers must be in increasing order.
