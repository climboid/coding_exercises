Certainly! Here are three challenging Python coding exercises at varying difficulty levels, along with the topics they test and their answers:

**Topic: File Handling and Text Manipulation**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python program that reads a large text file (e.g., "bigdata.txt") and finds the top 10 most frequent words in the file. Ignore common words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") and consider case-insensitivity. Display the words and their frequencies.



**Topic: Algorithm Design and Dynamic Programming**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python function to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings. For example, given the strings "ABCD" and "ACDF," the longest common subsequence is "ACD," so the function should return 3.



**Topic: Advanced Algorithm and Optimization**

**Exercise:**
Write a Python program to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for a given set of cities and their distances. The program should find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.
