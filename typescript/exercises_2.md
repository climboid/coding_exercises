###Topic: TypeScript Classes and Inheritance

**Exercise:**
Create a TypeScript class called `Shape` with properties `color` (string) and `area` (number). Then, create two subclasses: `Circle` and `Rectangle`. The `Circle` class should have an additional property `radius` (number), and the `Rectangle` class should have properties `width` (number) and `height` (number). Implement a method `calculateArea` in both the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes to calculate their respective areas.



###Topic: TypeScript Promises and Async/Await

**Exercise:**
Write a TypeScript function that takes a URL as a parameter and uses the `fetch` API to make an HTTP GET request to that URL. Handle the response using Promises and return the response data as a string. Use `async/await` syntax.


###Topic: TypeScript Advanced Types and Generics

**Exercise:**
Implement a TypeScript function called `mergeObjects` that takes two objects as input and returns a new object that combines the properties of both objects. If there are common property names, the values from the second object should overwrite the values from the first object. The function should be generic and work with any object type.
