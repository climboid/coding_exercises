**Topic: TypeScript Enums and Discriminated Unions**

**Exercise:**
Create a TypeScript enum called `ShapeType` with values 'Circle' and 'Rectangle'. Then, create a discriminated union type called `Shape` that represents either a circle or a rectangle. Implement functions to calculate the area of each shape and return the result.



**Topic: TypeScript Advanced Generics and Type Constraints**

**Exercise:**
Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of objects and a key (property name) and returns an array of unique values from that key across all objects. The function should work with objects of varying structures and should use generics and type constraints.



**Topic: TypeScript Advanced Types and Functional Programming**

**Exercise:**
Create a TypeScript type `FlattenArray<T>` that takes a nested array of any depth and flattens it into a single-dimensional array. Implement a function `flatten` that uses this type and flattens a given nested array.
