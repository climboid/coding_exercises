###Topic: TypeScript Interfaces and Classes

**Exercise:**
Create a TypeScript interface called `Person` with properties `name` (string) and `age` (number). Then, create a class `Student` that implements this interface and has an additional property `studentId` (string). Write a constructor for the `Student` class that initializes these properties.



###Topic: TypeScript Generics and Advanced Functions

**Exercise:**

The callback function should be applied to each element in the array, and the function should return an array of the results. Use TypeScript generics to make the function work with various types of arrays and callbacks.
